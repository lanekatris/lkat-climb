# Yet another climbing app... but simpler?

This spawned the creation of the [unofficial Rhinofit SDK](https://github.com/lanekatris/rhinofit-unofficial/blob/main/packages/client/README.md).

# Get it!
https://expo.io/@loonison101/projects/lkat-climb

# Why?
The apps out there are comprehensive and sometimes slow and error prone. A buddy gave me inspiration to accomplish the following:
* Track the count of boulder problems completed at the gym
* Compare to last sessions count of what was done (i.e. you climbed a V4 3 times last session, that is/could be your goal this time)
* Be fast!

Android users are good to go, you'll need to request a link if your on iOS to access this.

Your credentials are stored in Firebase Auth, I don't see them. Your Rhinofit credentials are stored locally on your phone, I don't persist them server side or log them.
